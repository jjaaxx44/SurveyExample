# SurveyExample
SurveyExample is a test for iOS dev @Nimble 

Few things to note,
1. For sample project, I have pushed all pods as well. 
   In live project it is better to just push pod file and rest of pod folders should be added in gits ".ignore".
2. There are many pods are used in sample project. Pods/third party libraries reduces development time, but adds extra overhead.
