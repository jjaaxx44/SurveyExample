# SurveyExample
SurveyExample is a test for iOS dev @Nimble 

Few things to note,
1. For sample project, I have pushed all pods as well. 
   In live project it is better to just push pod file and rest of pod folders should be added in gits ".ignore".
2. There are many pods used in sample project. Pods/third party libraries reduces development time, but adds extra overhead.
3. As per my understanding, I have created another branch, and created a pull request to merge with master from same account.
   I hope this was the requirement.
4. By default, app fetches 5 surveys, burger menu button can be used to increase number of surveys by 5, till max 20 surveys.
5. Added left and right button to navigate between survey pages.
6. Images used in app are royalty free images from https://icons8.com. Some images are edited using gimp
